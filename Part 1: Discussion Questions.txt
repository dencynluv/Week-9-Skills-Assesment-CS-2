Part 1: Discussion Questions

Recursion

1. In your own words, what is Recursion?
    
    Recursion happens when a function calls itself within its own function.


2. Why is it necessary to have a Base Case?

    A base case is necessary in order for the function to know its stopping point. 


Graphs

1. What is a Graph?

    A graph is similar to a tree in that they contain nodes. However in a graph the nodes are connected through edges and can loop.


2. How is a Graph different from a Tree?

    A graph is different from a tree because a graph contain loops/cycles and their relationships can be directed or non-directed. Nodes on a graph are also connected through edges/arcs and can also be adjacent to one another when they share an edge. 


3. Give an example of something that would be good to model with a Graph.

    Hackbright Alumni all share a connection through cohorts or Hackbright. A group text shared between friends, connection between countries and cities, flights that connect to different cities. 


Performance of Different Data Structures

Fill in the runtimes for the following actions for the table below:

Data Structure                  Index   Search  Add-R   Add-L   Pop-L   Pop-R
______________________________________________________________________________
Python List(Array)              O(1)    O(n)    O(1)   O(n)     O(n)    O(1)  
Linked List                     O(n)    O(n)    O(1)   O(1)     O(1)    O(n)
Doubly-Linked List              O(n)    O(n)    O(1)   O(1)     O(1)    O(1)  
Queue (as Array)                X       X       O(1)   X        O(n)    X      
Queue (as LL or DLL)            X       X       O(1)   X        O(1)    X
Stack (as Array, LL, or DLL)    X       X       O(1)   X        X       O(1)
Deque (as DLL)                  X       X       O(1)   O(1)     O(1)    O(1)

Index: Find an item in the structure when you know its position
Search: Find an item in the structure when you know its data
Add(R/L): Set a key in set/dictionary or add node to tree
Pop(R/L): Remove a key or node


Fill in Runtime and Memory:

The answers for Dictionary have been provided; you should fill in the rest:

Data Structure          Get     Add     Delete  Iterate Memory
_______________________________________________________________
Dictionary (Hash Map)   O(1)    O(1)    O(1)    O(n)    medium
Set (Hash Map)          O(1)    O(1)    O(1)    O(n)    medium
Binary Search Tree      O(log n)O(n)    O(n)    O(1)    little         
Tree                    O(n)    O(1)    O(1)    O(1)    little

Get: Find an item in the structure
Add: Set a key in set/dictionary or add node to tree
Delete: Remove a key or node
Iterate: Find next item in data structure
Memory: Relative to data, how much memory is used? (Choices: a little, medium, or a lot)
